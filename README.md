# Snake Game (Assembly, NASM)

This repository contains a terminal-based Snake game implemented in x86-64 assembly using NASM. The project is fully cross-platform and runs in the command-line interface (CLI) without requiring any external libraries.

This project uses the `__anrc64` calling convention, documented in [`CONVENTION.md`](docs/CONVENTION.md).

A visual demonstration of the game and additional documentation are available on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/anar-bastanov/nasm-console-snake/wiki).

## Features

* Entirely written in x86-64 NASM assembly
* Cross-platform: Linux and Windows supported
* Terminal-based gameplay with real-time input
* Minimal dependencies: runs directly in the CLI
* Makefile-based build system
* Modular codebase for easier extension

## Building

Build instructions for supported platforms are available in [`BUILD.md`](docs/BUILD.md).
